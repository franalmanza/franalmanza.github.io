    <h1>Island Spirit</h1>
    <p>Palm trees are swaying island style<br>
Within the gentle trade wind's flow,<br>
As Egrets glide on salty air-<br>
Then land where verdant grasses grow.<br></p>

<p>Breathe in sweet scents of tuberose<br>
And let fine mist caress your face,<br>
Dive deep into aqua waters-<br>
Become enchanted with this place.<br></p>

<p>Let your eyes consume the beauty,<br>
Let rhythmic music soothe your mind.<br>
You'll feel the aloha spirit-<br>
A kinder people you won't find.<br></p>

<p>Go hiking in hillside forests,<br>
There are no bears or snakes that hide,<br>
Just waterfalls you'll find waiting,<br>
That flow toward the ocean side.<br></p>

<p>In the distance whales are breaching,<br>
Humpbacks with little calves in tow.<br>
They share waters with the dolphins,<br>
And green sea turtles down below.<br>

Can you hear paradise calling?<br>
Whispering your name at sunrise,<br>
To later bask on pearly sands.<br>
Swaying hula hips at moonrise,<br></p>

<p>Coaxing you to join in the dance.<br>
Exotic Mai Tai in your hands,<br>
Sweet flower leis caress your neck,<br>
Come investigate our islands,<br></p>

<p>And board on wild waves at surfside,<br>
Cast your cold and cares to the breeze.<br>
Sailing out on sunset cruises-<br>
Take homeward bound warm memories.<br></p>
