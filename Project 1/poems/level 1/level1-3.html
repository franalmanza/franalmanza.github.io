    <h1>Island &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br> Spirit</h1>
    <p>Palm trees are swaying <br>  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  island style<br>
Within &nbsp; &nbsp; the &nbsp; &nbsp; gentle &nbsp; &nbsp; trade&nbsp; &nbsp;  wind's&nbsp; &nbsp;  flow,<br>
As Egrets glide on salty air-<br>
Then land where verdant grasses grow.<br></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  Breathe in sweet scents of tuberose<br>
And let fine mist caress your face,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Dive deep into aqua waters-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  Become enchanted with this place.<br></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  Let your eyes consume the beauty,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  Let rhythmic music soothe your mind.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  You'll feel the aloha spirit-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  A kinder people you won't find.<br></p>

<p>Go hiking in hillside forests,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  There are no bears or snakes that hide,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;    Just waterfalls <br>you'll find waiting,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  That flow toward the ocean side.<br></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  In the &nbsp; &nbsp;  d&nbsp; &nbsp;  i&nbsp; &nbsp;  s&nbsp; &nbsp;  t&nbsp; &nbsp;  a&nbsp; &nbsp;  n&nbsp; &nbsp;  c&nbsp; &nbsp;  e <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  whales are breaching,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Humpbacks with little calves in tow.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  They share waters with the dolphins,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  And green sea turtles down <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  below.<br></p>

Can you hear paradise calling?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  Whispering your name at sunrise,<br>
To later bask on pearly sands.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  Swaying hula hips at moonrise,<br></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Coaxing you to &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;    join in the dance.&nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Exotic Mai Tai &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;   in your hands,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Sweet flower leis &nbsp; &nbsp;  caress your neck,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Come investigate &nbsp; &nbsp;  our islands,<br></p>

<p>And board on wild waves at &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surfside,<br>
Cast your cold and cares to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breeze.<br>
Sailing out on sunset &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cruises-<br><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take homeward bound warm memories.<br><br><br></p>
