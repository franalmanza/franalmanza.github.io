            Growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area, I have always admired how the old and the new can live in tandem with each other. There is this mutual respect among the citizens that is informed by a rich history of activism, preservation, and diversity. At Otis, I incorporated this way of thinking into my work.<br><br>

            I am a worrier. Design seems to ground that worry into a discussion. It opens up the reader or viewer to see what I am concerned about, what I am questioning, and when I do not have all the answers. This field is capable of getting groups of people together to trade insights and spark conversations that leave lasting impressions.<br><br>

            My time as a BFA student has been a journey of long nights, rigorous course work, free pizza, and working with the most eccentric group of people I have ever met. The end of my final year in college is bittersweet, yet it is evident to me that this is only the beginning of a life-long obsession with graphic design.
