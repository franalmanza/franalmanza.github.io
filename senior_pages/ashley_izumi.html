           As a second generation Chinese-Japanese American, I find myself telling personal stories and thoughts through my illustrations. In my work, I use color and texture to create a visually engaging imagery. It is also a way for me to explore the range of possibilities allowed through subtle changes in color choices, composition, and use of mediums. To do this, my artwork deals heavily on juxtaposing handwritten text with imagery to contextualizing the letter forms. This creates a personal tone to my work as well as to help me meditate on myself as a person. I also find myself doing this because of the notion of using comics/graphic novels as a venue to easily teach the viewers on a subject that matters to me. I find my need to use my work telling personal thoughts to the viewer as well as provoke different ideas from my peers. I find my work being a venue to say what some people are afraid of thinking. I find freedom in the work I produce. To me, my work is a safe haven for my thoughts and a stage for my ideas to shine.
