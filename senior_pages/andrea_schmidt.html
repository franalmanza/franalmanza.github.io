        <p>
            As an artist I'm very interested in the idea of low fantasy, where the supernatural exists in a world otherwise similar to our own - work that takes place in a forgotten time, or a time that never existed but could. I was young when I started dreaming up narratives rooted in this interest, and was deeply influenced by the animation scene when I was growing up.<br><br>


            A particular inspiration for me has always been the work of Hayao Miyazaki, who places you in this rich world but often focuses on the extremities of it. This is what makes it feel real to me, and gives me room to really explore the possibilities of the universe. And that is exactly what I want to do with my work: leave room to wonder, and provoke thoughtfulness.<br><br>

            But I want to do it in a way that is uniquely me: through humor, love stories, fantasy elements, and everything in between. Telling stories is the gateway to my inner life, my heart and soul. The themes, patterns and conventions I'm drawn to, the visuals that captivate me - I learn more about myself each time. It's how I want others to learn about me, too.
