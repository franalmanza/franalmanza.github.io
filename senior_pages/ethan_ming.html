            Ever since a was a little Ethan, I wanted to be a designer. Little Ethan wanted to design Yu-Gi-Oh
            cards. Adolescent Ethan wanted to design graphic tees and sneakers. I've always been a very
            visually oriented person. Like the only way I can remember directions is through visual markers
            that I see during the drive. Thank God for Google Maps.<br><br>
            Being able to nurture my skills as a designer in Los Angeles for the past four years has allowed
            me to develop a deeper appreciation for culture, popular culture in particular, being that the city is
            such a major hub of different groups and communities. I feel that popular culture is not only
            entertaining, but is also a reflection of the state of our society.<br><br>
            I love exploring and connecting elements of culture with design, the process of bringing order to
            chaos, and seeing how projects can seemingly create themselves under a system of restrictions.
            I'm just excited to be in the feld of design because it allows me to have a say in what our visual
            landscape looks like; that's really powerful to me. Whether it's through making posters, apps,
            books, logos, web banners, tee shirts, whatever. I'll be happy as long I get to leave my mark on the
            world, no matter what scale it's on - all of it is big to the little Ethan in me.
