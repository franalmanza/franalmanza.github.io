            In high school my senior quote was "Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up."  -Pablo Picasso, this quote always resonated with me. Since the age of four I always said I was going to be an artist and I never gave up on that hope. Now that my schooling at Otis is coming to an end and my life as a Graduated Artist begins I am proud to say I remain an artist. I improved my skills and learn many more, my days were spent learning Graphic Design, exploring Illustrating, and working on my crafts. I took many mind blowing classes that allowed me to explored all kinds of topics and helped me developed my studio works. I am grateful to be able to have the opportunity to go through this experience and to be blessed with great people in my life. I will continue to grow my skills, my practice and will proudly continue to be an artist.
