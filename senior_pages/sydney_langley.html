            I have always been into storytelling.  When it comes to illustration, storytelling is imperative in trying to communicate a message. For as long as I can remember, my nose has either been stuck in a book or pressed up against a television screen. I have continuously obsessed over cinema and literature with my favorite films and novels having a darker sense of humor or containing adult themes. I was lucky enough to have parents who never felt the need to shelter me from adult content and I believe that is reflected in my work. I try to conceptually combine satirical characters and situations with commentary on controversial subjects. This method of storytelling combined with a solid researched concept before pencil ever hits paper, is what makes me distinctive as an illustrator.
