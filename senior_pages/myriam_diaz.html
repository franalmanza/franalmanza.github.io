            My journey to becoming a designer began behind the lens of a camera. I spent my weekends in high school hitting up local music shows to photograph some of my friend's sets. It had opened me up to another world I instantly fell in love with. Music was what got me into design and art and has influenced the path I want to take. Since I was pretty young when I started, I had to really fight for my art, and I learned that passion really can take you far.

            There is so much power and influence design has over the way we live our daily lives. As a designer I am inspired by all that life has to offer. I donâ€™t have an exact direction I want to go within design but I am definitely interested in exploring many different methods from web design, branding, animation, motion graphics, etc. I would say music and design have a great impact in my life, and I see myself within the entertainment industry covering a wide range of what design has to offer me.
