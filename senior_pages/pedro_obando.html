        <p>
            Born and raised in Houston, Texas I was immediately propelled into a diverse community. I love engaging with new people to learn about the things that make each individual unique. A passion for surrealism, photography, painting, and dream-like imagery which has always reminded me that there's a better world in one's own imagination. <br><br>

            Unfortunately, the recent campaign for the presidential nominations has created propaganda and sparked dormant anger in many people. The anger is spreading like wildfire and references the moments of when the civil rights movement began to rise. This anger has inspired many to become aware of the corruption in the government and in our society. The political arson that has spread is all the more reason my work has been inspired by this pivotal moment. <br><br>

            I create work that carries my social commentary on the world and I aim to make my work bring people together especially, during this moment in time where influential figures are trying to divide us. I also intend for everyone to reevaluate one’s own actions and in order to become more engaged in our society and in return discover new ways to impact the world positively.  It is time to face this hatred and corruption head on and we can only triumph when we stand united.
