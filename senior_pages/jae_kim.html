        <p>
            I am a Los Angeles based designer with a focus in typography, visual identity, and environmental graphics for organizations I am passionate about. Since a young artist, I have always been influenced by urban art and how it allowed anyone to freely communicate in a public space visually. At the time, doing street art was just a hobby. But little did I know, later this would bloom a new perspective of the world and more importantly a passion of how to communicate to an audience using visual rhetoric. Whether it's branding a campaign or setting typography, my approach to effective visual communication span the mediums of: logos, uniquely designed fonts, publications, posters, clothing, social media, and environmental graphics. I trust in methodology, teamwork, and intuition with every project I approach. What I strive for with design is sophistication that is not sterile, bringing the hip into the ordinary, and communicating concepts creatively, clearly, and transparently.
