            Growing up, I've never really felt like I belonged in any one particular place. I was either too smart, too slow, too fast, too rational, or too imaginative. Because of this I became reserved, quietly observing my surroundings and the people around them; silently jotting down notes in my mind. Drawing helped me express these ideas and observations in a way that didn't make me seem as strange because in everyone's mind a drawing is only a representation, not the real thing. The real thing. What is real? I found myself asking this question about everything. Are we living on this planet as little dolls inside a huge playset? Do other people see me the way I see me? Are those actors in that television series really acting?<br><br>

            What sounds like a struggled distinguishing reality from fiction, is truly where most of my greatest ideas come from. Questioning the norm and offering alternative solutions for it’s existance, that's what I do. Designing allows me to dissect a problem, look at it from all possible angles, and really try to understand the mechanics behind its solution. Through these explorations I've come to realize that perfection is relative. In truth, nothing is perfect. And if nothing is perfect, imperfect designers making "perfect" things for imperfect audiences seems futile. I don’t want to create perfect experiences, objects, or work. Who am I to claim a space above the human being by claiming perfection? I'd rather make work that imitated humans. We breath, feel, grow and change. We have names, homes, friends, and styles. I want to make design human again.
